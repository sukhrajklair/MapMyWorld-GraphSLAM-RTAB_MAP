# Map My World - GraphSLAM using RTAB-MAP
This robotic program performs Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using graph technique. The robot and its environment are simulated in gazebo. The robot is equipped with a depth camera and a LIDAR. The program uses RTAB_MAP ros package.

RTAB_MAP package: [ROS Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/rtabmap_ros), [github]( https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap_ros)
